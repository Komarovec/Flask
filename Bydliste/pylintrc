# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

# C0111: Missing module docstring -- complains too much (e.g. empty "__init__.py")
# E1103: Instance has no member (but some types could not be inferred) -- does not play nice with requests
# E1120: No value for argument in constructor -- doesn't play nice with some SQLAlchemy types (e.g. Boolean)
# I0011: Locally disabling -- I disabled for a reason
# R0401: Cylic import -- Doesn't play nice with blueprints
